# ZedPvP
This was from a factions server that I worked alongside my previous employer from Shotbow, Dellis.
Unfortunately, the project was killed and development ceased. All of the code in this repository is unfinished and old.

## About each project
**Core**: Was the grounding for the custom factions core. It was going to be a fun and unique factions system.

**Scoreboard**: The temporary plugin in place for the spigot premium plugin factions core I emplored Dellis to get rid of

**Keaton**: Literally just a modified version of Exile. The base was updated and a few more checks were added and fixed.


## Why is this being released?
I decided someone could maybe try and continue what I've started to make a great server for the community to enjoy. Hopefully it goes well for them.

*Credits to fyu for the PacketAPI I don't remember using I guess.*
